Hello! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the KU Leuven, Faculty of Economics and Business. In March 2025, I will join LUISS as an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Business and Management](https://impresaemanagement.luiss.it/). I hold the _Seal of Excellence_ under the Marie Curie MSCA fellowship. I hold a PhD in Management Engineering from University of Pisa and former member of [B4DS](http://b4ds.unipi.it/).

I am an interdisciplinary researcher working at the intersection of **Economics of Science** and **Engineering Management**, driven by a passion for _Natural Language Processing_. My background is deeply rooted in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. My research journey began with contributions to (past) **Engineering Management** and has evolved to focus on (current) **Economics of Science**.

My [first paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16437) in the **Economics of Science** is forthcoming at _Review of Economics and Statistics_ (with Sam Arts and Reinhilde Veugelers).
