Hello! I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Business and Management](https://impresaemanagement.luiss.it/) at **LUISS University**. 

In Fall 2025, I am visiting the TIES Group at the MIT Sloan School of Management.

I am also affiliated with the Faculty of Economics and Business at KU Leuven, where I was a postdoctoral researcher from 2022 to 2025. I hold the _Seal of Excellence_ under the Marie Curie MSCA fellowship. I hold a PhD in Management Engineering from University of Pisa and former member of [B4DS](http://b4ds.unipi.it/).
